## Grid System


### Column grid
This framework allows you to set the number of columns to be used throughout your website by changing one specific value in the **_vars.scss** file.

    $gd-count: 12;

The variable **$gd-count** allows you to change the value of the grid count to however many columns you want to start with. The default is 12.
